      "There’s an intrinsic value in creating something for the sake of creating it."<br>
      — Rodney Mullen<br>
      <br>
      Create something. If you don't want to create from scratch, then break something and start from there. If you
      don't want to break something, then improve something. Try new mediums, new tools. Make your tools. Or make up a
      reason to get new tools. Get into woodworking and make a chair. Or a table. Get into video and record a short
      film. Download a music software and make sounds with it. Rip old jeans apart and stitch them again. Paint a wall.
      Paint two walls. Create a blog. Write on it. Write a book. Write a book and don't publish it. Write a book and
      publish it. Write a book and publish it and don't tell anyone. Write a book and publish it and tell everyone.<br>
      <br>
      The most important thing is to keep creating. Doesn't matter what, doesn't matter to whom, doesn't matter how
      good. Just create. And have fun doing it.<br>
