    <article-title>There's No Advertising Like Events</article-title>
    <article-text>
      Make a great event, a memorable tuesday afternoon, and people will talk about you for months. An event like this
      will bring you more than ads around the city, and will cost less.<br>
      <br>
      During my time at Turbine Kreuzberg, I had the pleasure to work on a few events. Here are some of them.<br>

      <h2>Tech Meetup Porto 2023</h2>
      Event held at Selina Navis Coworking, Porto. I took care of the visuals and copy and helped my team with general
      logistics, <a href="https://www.meetup.com" target="_blank"><s>Meetup.com</s></a> maintenance and Social Media
      posts. We had a near-total of 70 attendees, a tech-focused talk and a discussion panel about women in tech. The
      event was a success, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. During the weeks after the event we noticed a
      significant increase in our Social Media followers visits. And a constant, weekly Meetup follower growth that
      lasted several months.

      <h2>PHP Meetup Lisboa '23</h2>
      Event held at Heden Rossio, Lisboa. I took care of the visuals and copy, and helped my team with general
      logistics, Meetup.com maintenance and Social Media posts. This was a smaller event, with a total of 30 attendees,
      but marked the beginning of a series of events across the country. This event served as a test for our team, and a
      proof that the best way to get people to know you is to get out there and meet them. After this event, we had an
      influx of Lisbon based developers applying to our team, and a significant increase in our Social Media followers
      visits.

      <h2>University Events</h2>
      If you're looking for a steady, long-term team growth, then Universities and related schools are the best place to
      showcase your brand. Students are eager to learn about as many companies as possible, they are open to new ideas,
      and more importantly, if they like you, they will talk about you. They will even compare you to other companies,
      and if you stand out, they will remember you over other companies.
