        This experiment was fruitful and fun. Burned David now knows better to not sound so much like a "design life coach" in future articles. Enjoy the roast!

        Roast me and my articles
      </message>
      <br>
      First off, your writing voice screams:<br>
      "I’m approachable, quirky, and friendly, please like me — but also take me seriously because I read some Medium articles about design once."<br>
      <br>
      Every blog post feels like you’re trying to sneak into the Design Hall of Fame through the side door by charming the bouncer with a wink and a half-smile.<br>
      <br>
      You’ve also mastered the ancient art of saying “I’m just a humble generalist, don’t mind me,” while simultaneously making sure we never forget you’re exactly the kind of thoughtful generalist the world needs right now. That’s not humility, that’s humblebragging in Helvetica.<br>
      <br>
      And let’s talk about structure: sometimes your posts are tighter than a UX designer’s black turtleneck, other times they ramble like you accidentally left your brain on shuffle. It’s like you can’t decide if you’re writing a thoughtful design essay or narrating a YouTube vlog no one asked for.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <message style="display: block; margin-left: auto; width: fit-content; padding: 1em 1.5em; border: var(--primary) 2px solid; border-radius: 12px 12px 0px;">
        Now roast my design takes
      </message>
      <br>
      Your vibe of “generalist by heart”? Translation: “I couldn’t commit to learning Illustrator properly, so now I’m branding myself as versatile.” You’re basically the design world’s Swiss Army knife—handy, but no one ever says “wow, this steak tastes amazing because of that tiny fold-out blade.”<br>
      <br>
      Also—your design philosophy seems to be 40% “be nice,” 30% “think about people,” and 30% “Figma shortcuts are cool.” Which, to be fair, makes sense… but also feels like you’re trying to TED Talk your way out of doing actual design work.<br>
      <br>
      The wild part? You deliver all this with so much sincerity and charm that people probably nod along like you’re dropping wisdom—when half the time you’re basically just rebranding “common sense” as “design insight.” You’re the design world’s life coach.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <message style="display: block; margin-left: auto; width: fit-content; padding: 1em 1.5em; border: var(--primary) 2px solid; border-radius: 12px 12px 0px;">
        Burn it all to the ground, hurt me.
      </message>
      <br>
      Your portfolio and blog read like you went into design not to solve problems but to cosplay as a philosopher who happens to know where the “bold” button is in Figma. Every “insight” is basically a shower thought padded into 800 words: “What if… design is actually about people?” Bro. That’s not a design take, that’s a fridge magnet.<br>
      <br>
      Your articles have this “self-aware but not really” tone, like you’re desperately trying to preemptively soften criticism: “Hey, I’m just a humble generalist, don’t mind me lol.” No—commit. Right now you’re like a comedian who laughs at his own jokes before the audience can. If you have to tell me you’re a generalist every five minutes, it just sounds like you couldn’t get good at one thing.<br>
      <br>
      You position yourself as this big-picture thinker—yet your big picture is basically: “Make things clear, keep it human, lol I’m quirky.” That’s not vision, that’s common sense with better formatting. You’re not the Elon Musk of design, you’re the guy at the whiteboard drawing circles and arrows while someone else actually builds the product.<br>
      <br>
      And don’t get me started on your “communication designer” label. It’s giving “I wanted to say graphic designer but that didn’t sound deep enough.” You’ve basically found the most pretentious way possible to say, “I make stuff look nice and write words sometimes.”<br>
      <br>
      At the end of the day, your portfolio is like a beautifully plated meal made entirely out of instant noodles. It looks neat, it photographs well, but anyone who actually takes a bite is like: “…this is just ramen.”<br>
      <br>

        I... I think that’s enough roasting for one day
