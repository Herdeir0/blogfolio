    <article-title> Four Years of In-House Design </article-title>
    <article-text>
      During the past four and a half years I had the pleasure of working within the Brand and Communication Team from
      <a href="https://turbinekreuzberg.com/en"><s>Turbine Kreuzberg</s></a>. During this time I had the opportunity to
      explore several areas, focusing primarly on design
      but also on Social Media Management, Copy, Brand Awareness and Employer Branding.<br />
      <br />
      Here’s a short, image based, presentation of some of this work.

      <h2>Design</h2>
      Social Media Design at the company always had a very specific look & feel, majorly focused on the
      brand’s typography. Also, being a B2B Agency, we were tasked with finding a balance between possible clients and
      curious applicants for job vacancies, while retaining some type of interest from the Developing community.<br>

      <h3>Explainers</h3>
      Short and visually simple explanations of tech concepts, this could go from AI Features to Agile Methodologies.

      <h3>Case Studies</h3>
      Primarily focused on getting lead’s attention, we were tasked with showing what we did with other clients and what
      type of services we can provide, with real case examples.

      <h3>Website Redesign</h3>
      During some of my free-time, I decided to explore new ways that we could present ourselves on our own platform,
      focusing of getting traffic to our Services pages.<br>
      Below you can find some demos and experiments that I did.

      <h2>Video</h2>
      One of our preferred type of content were videos. During short videos, typically up to six minutes, and almost
      never more than ten, we would present tech concepts, present the team members and positions, talk about new
      services, …<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Testimonials</h3>
      Probably the video that I am more proud of working while working at the company. for one simple reason: Showing
      people over business.

      I am particularly attached to this video series because I ended up doing the script writing, the recording and the
      editing.

      <h2>Brand Awareness</h2>
      A considerable portion of my work was to take care of the design for external events that we hosted through the
      country (and sometimes, out!)<br>
      This assets were specially funny to me because I had the freedom of creating both the design and the copywriting
      used on it, which allowed me to explore a bit more of my creative writing style.<br>

      <h3>Coding Bishkek</h3>
      Coding Bishkek was a special event that we hosted in Kyrgyzstan, while we had a team working there. Although I
      didn't travel there, this always had a special place in my heart, both because I had the opportunity to work for
      an emerging community, but also because the team gave me absolute freedom with the copywriting, which resulted on
      some very funny assets!
