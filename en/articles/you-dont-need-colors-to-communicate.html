    <article-title> You don't need colors to communicate </article-title>
    <article-text>
      Only if you want to do it right.<br />
      <br />
      Imagine this: You’re given a circle on a square canvas. What can you do
      with it if you can only use black and white? Surely not much. A black
      circle on a white background, or a white circle on a black
      background.<br />
      By itself, it doesn’t mean much, doesn’t it? Perhaps the white circle is
      the moon in the night sky. Maybe the black circle on the white
      background is… Well, a dot on white paper.<br />

      But now add some color to it. Blues, reds, yellows,... (You're familiar
      with colors, aren't you?) Suddenly, a simple circle is not so simple
      anymore. It’s… Complex!<br />
      <br />
      Now, a circle can be a giant celestial body. It can be the sun, as you
      see it from your front door. Or Mars, our rusty pal. Or Neptune, who is
      “just” around the corner. Just two colors and we've already traveled
      over four billion kilometers.

      Thanks to colors (thank you colors!) a circle can be as big as the sun
      or as small as a golf ball ready to be putted. Or a meatball in tomato
      sauce. It can also be Japan (you were waiting for this one, weren’t
      you?…)

      But communication isn’t only made up of circles on solid backgrounds
      (yes, I know, what a shock!)<br />
      <br />
      Let’s not define what a letter is, but from a very simplistic point of
      view, a letter is just like a circle, except that it has a specific
      meaning attached to it, whereas a circle, as we saw, can be many things.
      Combine several letters and you now have a word. Congratulations, you’re
      a writer!<br />
      <br />
      By itself, a word already has a meaning, so, using colors isn’t
      necessary to communicate. Right? Well, right. But also wrong! Sure, you
      don’t need colors to say “Attention! There’s too much CO2 in this
      garage!”, but let’s take a look below, shall we?

        Image 9 and 10: two similar images with the text “Attention high CO2
        levels”, the first one with black text on white background, the other
        with white text on red background.

      Tell the truth: where did you look first? To the colorless sign that can
      pretty much pass unnoticed? Or to the yelling red sign, that is becoming
      a nuisance because it makes it difficult to read this text without
      looking at it? Color just saved your life!<br />
      <br />
      Let’s take a look at a less dramatic scenario:<br />
      Your boss asks you to see the income reports for the last year for the
      two brands that he owns. He’s already pissed at you because you ignored
      the alarm clock too many times during the past few weeks. Your job is at
      stake. What do you present to him?<br />
      <br />
      Option A: a mess of lines;<br />
      <br />
      Option B: a mess of lines that you can differentiate and follow, giving
      you useful information.<br />

        Image 11 and 12: two similar images of an oversimplified graph where
        the lines intersect multiple times, the first image is only using
        black lines while the second image is using colored lines

      I hope that you chose well because you have bills to pay. Of course this
      is a hyperbole, but you get the point: Colors are crucial when it comes
      to organizing data (or anything, really).<br />
      <br />
      Another example: You are hired to create a giant outdoor advertisement
      for a Michelin-starred restaurant that is world famous for its
      meatballs, which image would you choose?

      This one is obvious! Who would want some gray, sad, and unpleasant
      looking food when you can have such a vibrant and colorful (but still
      overpriced) plate of food?<br />
      Ever wonder why McDonald's doesn’t have menus printed in grayscale?
      Well, that’s why! Colors sell. And believe it or not, if you start using
      colors on your menus, your profits will make up for the color cartridge
      expenses. Or maybe not, don’t quote me on that… (Argh! to those big
      printer companies, argh I say!)<br />
      <br />
      Colors have the power to activate emotions and sensations. They have the
      ability to create order where there was none. And when well used, they
      also allow you to write beautiful stories using only circles (if, of
      course, you’re only planning to write a story about Japanese meatballs
      playing golf on Mars). But colors can also have a deeper, more poetic
      sense to them: blue means sadness, white means hope, and numbers in
      green on your bank account will always make you happier than red
      ones.<br />
      So, yeah, you don’t need colors to communicate. Only if you want do it
      right!
