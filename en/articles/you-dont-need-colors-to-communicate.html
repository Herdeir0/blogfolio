        Only if you want to do it right.<br>
<br>
Imagine this: You’re given a circle on a square canvas. What can you do with it if you can only use black and white? Surely not much. A black circle on a white background, or a white circle on a black background.<br>
By itself, it doesn’t mean much, doesn’t it? Perhaps the white circle is the moon in the night sky. Maybe the black circle on the white background is… Well, a dot on white paper.<br />
        <br />

          >Then something clicked on me: You can’t break Notion (unless you
          really try)</i

        It was the perfect tool to lose myself and experiment different types of
        organization. There’s tables, there’s databases, you can embed other
        platforms within, you can upload lossless images and videos, searching
        filters, rules and automations and much, much more. All within the same
        infinite page, just a click away.

        But all of these were just experiments, there wasn’t really no reason
        behind them… Until I realized that my team was fighting something that I
        could solve. By that time, I was working on the marketing team. We had
        three main databases, all with their own Kanban boards:<br />
