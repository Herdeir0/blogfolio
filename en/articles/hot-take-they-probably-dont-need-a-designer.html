      Hot take: They (Probably) Don't Need a Designer</article-title>
    <article-text>
      I know. It’s a strong and depreciative stance, but don’t hate me yet…<br />
      <br />
      On my very first day as a design student, I was told that “We
      [designers] are important because we solve problems”, and, as a
      motivational motto, that’s fine. However, take out what’s in between the
      brackets and forget the context, and you'll get: “We are important
      because we solve problems” and that doesn't mean much, really. Designers
      are important because they solve problems, but so do engineers and
      mechanics, managers and recruiters, gardeners and plumbers. Solving a
      problem is not the reason why a job is important, it’s the reason why
      that job exists. Problems create jobs.<br />
      <br />
      There was a need to communicate better and faster, and so design was
      born—and with it, the designers’ species.<br />
      <br />
      Now let's get back to the title of this article, but this time let’s
      rephrase it as a question: “Do they need a designer?”<br />
      To which I answer: “Well, probably not!”<br />
      <br />
      Sure, it might be cool to redesign your local mini-market. Maybe you
      have some cool ideas for that old, independent, second-hand clothing
      store on the corner of your street. However, ask yourself if it makes
      sense for that small business owner to invest in design, especially
      during these times of economic and social crisis. Surely what they do
      with their money is totally their choice, but you, as the service
      provider, should always keep in mind the power that your service has and
      what it will cost your client.<br />
      <br />
      When being approached by a potentially new client, ask them if this
      really is the step that they want to take. Be conscious of the changes
      that the redesign will bring to their business. Is design what their
      business needs? Will the new sales compensate for the cost of your
      service? Maybe not.<br />
      <br />
      Let’s take a look at a hypothetical example:<br />
      Charlie has a restaurant. And Charlie’s restaurant is going through some
      hard times, the business is losing clients, and paying the employees is
      getting harder every month. Therefore, Charlie decides that what the
      restaurant needs is a new image. From a big logo on the wall to new
      branded menus and napkins, Charlie wants it all. You—the
      designer—receive Charlie’s invitation for a small talk regarding this
      project at their restaurant. Now it should be the designer’s job not
      only to listen, but also to talk. Sure, you can do everything that
      Charlie asks for, but the question that you should now answer is: Will
      this help Charlie’s business?<br />
      <br />
      Design costs money, you’re obviously not doing it for free (right?), and
      the truth is that maybe Charlie could be using that same money on a
      higher priority. Is it the lack of branded napkins that is pushing
      clients away, or is it the weird smell in the air? Is the new logotype
      going to help sales if the service is bad? Having a new Social Media
      image will surely not help with the taste of the food (sorry, chef!).<br />
      <br />
      As a Charlie, a new and beautiful design might look like the only answer
      to the problem. Maybe for lack of self-awareness or just the fear of
      admitting that there are bigger, deeper issues, Charlie did not
      understand that the issue was not the lack of design, so they will go
      after what’s missing instead of what’s wrong.<br />
      <br />
      As the designer, you should have the professional responsibility of
      guiding people through situations like these. Being honest (not only
      with Charlie, but with yourself) could have prevented Charlie from
      drowning their business in a deeper, although beautiful, mess.<br />
      <br />
      This problem, however, does not only occur via client-seeks-designer. It
      can also occur when a freelance designer pitches their services to a
      potentially new client. As the service provider, you should ask yourself
      before hand if the possible new client really needs your services,
      because it might happen that they agree with you, ignorant of the
      possible prejudice that they are about to cause to their business.
      Design, in the right hands, can act like a beautiful bait. Whoever is
      the prey might not fully comprehend the necessity of design, and that
      should be a main concern when pitching your services. I would say that a
      good rule of thumb would be to ask yourself if you would be selling that
      service to a close relative or friend. Empathy for the client should
      come before the money talk.<br />
      <br />
      Designers have the ability to create astounding visual and conceptual
      work that might leave some mouths open, but this power should come with
      the responsibility of understanding that “just because you can, doesn’t
      mean that you should”.<br />
      <br />
      See it like this: would it be okay for a pharmacist, someone that we
      tend to blindly trust, to try to sell you something that you don’t
      actually need? The same thought can be applied to a designer trying to
      sell a service to someone who, ignorant of its need, might agree with
      the designer simply because that person will trust the service seller
      with the beautiful presentation.<br />
      <br />
      In a utopia, this wouldn’t happen because not only would the designer
      have empathy for the client, but also because the client should
      understand what's best for their business. However, we don’t live in a
      perfect world. So it should be up to us, designers, to understand the
      needs of our job, and to explain them to others when it is obvious that
      they don’t fully grasp why they would need a design.<br />
      <br />
      We live in a time where visuality sells more than quality. And
      unfortunately, many small business owners cannot compete with the huge,
      global companies that constantly overshadow them. These particular
      owners are the ones that might, in an act of despair, think of a visual
      makeover for their business as the solution. Sometimes ignorant of the
      fact that they should only work on the outside after figuring out what’s
      wrong on the inside.<br />
      <br />
      There’s so much that design can do. Charlie might have new cutlery with
      their logo on it, but that (probably) will not change the fact that
      people are choosing another restaurant over them. So, don’t try to sell
      Charlie a vision of hope that the new design is the answer; instead, try
      to help their business understand what is wrong at its core.<br />
      <br />
      Selling design as the ultimate solution when it obviously is not will
      not only hurt your reputation but also the reputation of the design
      community. Next time that Charlie thinks of hiring a designer, they
      might remember that one time when it didn’t work, and so they might not
      do it. Even if a designer is necessary.<br />
      <br />
      I’m not asking you, fellow designer, to agree with me. I know that this
      is a controversial opinion, especially when getting new clients is what
      puts food on your table. The morality of design should be left for the
      designer to dictate. The empathy should be for the human.
