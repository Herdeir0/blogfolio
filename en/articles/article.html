    <article-title> Think your Notion databases ahead </article-title>
    <article-text>
      I was introduced to Notion a few years ago, by that time it was a much
      simpler tool and we were using it as a simple Wiki: static text without
      much interactiveness. To me it was simply a set of pages with text and
      images, and everything was accessible online on a centralized
      platform.<br />
      <br />
      <i>Then something clicked on me: You can’t break Notion (unless you
        really try)</i><br />
      It was the perfect tool to lose myself and experiment different types of
      organization. There’s tables, there’s databases, you can embed other
      platforms within, you can upload lossless images and videos, searching
      filters, rules and automations and much, much more. All within the same
      infinite page, just a click away.

      But all of these were just experiments, there wasn’t really no reason
      behind them… Until I realized that my team was fighting something that I
      could solve. By that time, I was working on the marketing team. We had
      three main databases, all with their own Kanban boards:<br />
