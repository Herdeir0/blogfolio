    <article-title>Think Your Notion<br> Databases Ahead</article-title>

      I was introduced to Notion a few years ago. By that time we were just
      using it as a simple Wiki: online pages with some text and images.
      Impressive wasn’t at all the word to describe it. A few months later,
      amidst a team restructure, something clicked:<br />
      <br />
      <i>You can’t break Notion (unless you really try to)</i>
      <br />
      Notion is the perfect tool to lose yourself and experiment different
      types of organization. There’s tables and databases, you can embed other
      platforms on it, you can upload lossless images and videos, apply
      searching filters, rules and automations. And the best of all: Real time
      collaboration.<br />
      <br />
      In a matter of months, our Notion use grew like crazy.

    <article-text>
      Fast forward a few months in, I realized that my team was fighting an
      organizational issue that I could solve. Here’s the thing: We had three
      main, separated databases, all with their own
      <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards"><s>Kanban boards</s></a>
      and tickets.
    </article-text>
    <article-image>

          and Tasks" />
      <text-caption role="none">

        and Tasks

    </article-image>
    <article-text>
      Because these boards were all created at different times, by various
      people, they didn’t look the same. In a way, these boards evolved with
      us, and you could tell that by the way that each one was constructed.
      This meant, for example, that there were several properties with
      equivalent meaning that had different name structures. And when you’re
      scaling, that’s truly a bad idea.<br>

        better understading the issues and to keep information confidential.</callout>

    <article-text>
      Another issue was the existence of duplicate tickets. A Sale Campaign
      action will very probably also be a Social Media action, and if it meant
      preparing some assets for printing, it would also be a Tasks action.
      <!--Only on very rare occasions we had tickets spanning the three databases,
        but it was very common to have duplicates between Sales and Socials, as
        they are practically the same.--><br />
      Duplicates also meant that there was two (and sometimes three)
      communication routes. A ticket could have the status “waiting for
      approval” while the other equivalent ticket could have “approved, post
      within three days”.<br />
      <br />
      This happened because the databases were not synced. But they could be.
    </article-text>

        alt="Image with the text Get Synced, where the N was replaced by Notion's logomark" />
    </article-image>
    <article-text>
      An option to solve this could be merging databases. It’s something that
      Notion allows users to do, but given that we had mismatching properties,
      the amount of work that it would require made me decide against it. For
      reference, doing this would mean:<br />
      <br />
      Open ticket ⇾ Check all data ⇾ Get every property right ⇾ Delete
      obsolete properties ⇾ Repeat<br />
      <br />
      This wouldn’t even tackle the duplicates issue, as it would import all
      the tickets to the same database, and the user would need to add the
      action “choose which duplicate ticket to delete” to this already
      exhausting list of tasks.<br />
      <br />
      Taking this into consideration, I decided to go the manual way. Create a
      new database and one by one import all the tickets. Sounds slow right?
      Truth is, searching for the fastest solution was becoming the slowest
      approach. I was getting too focused on finding the most efficient way of
      dealing with the issue, when just "dealing with the issue" was the best
      way to approach it. In the end, it didn't took more than a day or two to
      have it totally done. Not bad at all. But before starting importing all
      the tickets, there was some steps that had to be done...<br />
      <br />
      First, we have to decide what properties will be needed. This is not
      only an exercise of future-proofing your system, but also a work of
      nomenclature and classes.<br />
      <br />
      For this, new properties might be created and older ones might be
      deleted. The important is to keep the train of thought simple, open,
      preferably on a reading order, and avoid very specific properties (a
      "Local" property is probably unnecessary for a Communications’ team, but
      the "Media Channels" is very important!).<br />
      <br />
      So, for properties, here’s what I decided:<br />
      <br />
      <ul>
        <b>Captain</b>
        (Property Type: Person)<br />
        The main face of the ticket, usually the person to contact in case of
        any doubts;
      </ul>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <b>People</b>
        (Multi-select)<br />
        More than one person can be simultaneously working on the same task,
        so this is where you tag everyone;
      </ul>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <b>Date</b>
        (Date)<br />
        The relevant date of each topic;
      </ul>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <b>Media Channel</b>
        (Multi-select)<br />
        Platform where will it be published;
      </ul>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <b>Tags</b>
        (Multi-select)<br />
        To make search for archived tickets easier;
      </ul>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <b>Databases</b>
        (Multi-select)<br />
        The database to which the ticket should be attached to;
      </ul>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <b>Status</b>
        (Selection)<br />
        The current status of the ticket;
      </ul>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <b>Priority</b>
        (Selection)<br />
        The level of importance of each task;
      </ul>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <b>Comments</b>
        (Text)<br />
        Extra bits of information;
      </ul>
      <br />
      <callout>
        <b>Important!</b><br />
        For this system to work, it’s necessary to implement a disciplined
        ticket creation. Not filling the Database Property will result on not
        seeing the ticket on your "pseudo-databases".

      Second, we simply need to create different table views that filter the
      Database property input. This will allow you to create the perception of
      different databases, as you’ll only see specific tickets in each
      view.<br />
      <br />
      Using Notion’s Filter option, after creating a new table view, we apply
      the filter “Database contains” followed by the view’s target. So,
      following my team’s example, after all filters get applied we should
      have a table with at least three different views (Social Media, Tasks
      and Sales Campaigns), and each view will only show you tickets that have
      those databases applied.<br />
      <br />
      If you make the Database property a Multi-select type, you should also
      be able to see tickets that are shared between databases. That’s where
      the magic is!<br />
      <br />
      We now have "Synced Pseudo-Databases". Remember, all of this is just one
      database, but because we’re filtering out based on the ticket’s
      property, it gives the impression and functionality of several
      databases.

      <text-caption>Example of synced "pseudo-databases". The same ticket can be accessed
        from different databases if properly configured.</text-caption>
    </article-image>
    <article-text>After some orientation and restructuring of processes, this proved to
      be a great way of organizing tickets across several boards. As I see it,
      the pros of synchronous databases highly outpace the cons of time
      invested on rebuilding the system.<br />
      <br />
      By syncing the information, we allow communication to flow undoubtedly
      between teammates, without the need for extra messages, reducing the
      time needed to pick up tasks. It also simplifies the life of the team’s
      coordinator: there are no more duplicates, plus, changes applied to a
      ticket will be reachable independently of the "pseudo-database" that
      you’re at.<br />
