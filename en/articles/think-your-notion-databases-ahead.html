      <article-title> Think your Notion databases ahead </article-title>
      <article-text>
        I was introduced to Notion a few years ago, by that time we were just
        using it as a simple Wiki: some online pages with text and images.
        Impressive wasn’t at all the word to describe it. Then, a few months
        later, amidst a team restructure, something clicked on me:<br />
        <br />
        <i>You can’t break Notion (unless you really try).</i>
        <br />
        Notion is the perfect tool to lose yourself and experiment different
        types of organization. There’s tables, databases, you can embed other
        platforms on it, you can upload lossless images and videos, apply
        searching filters, rules and automations. And the best of all: Real time
        collaboration.<br />
        <br />
        In a matter of months, our Notion use grew like crazy.

        Fast forward a few months, and I start to realize that my team was
        fighting an organizational issue that I could solve. Here’s the thing:
        We had three main, separated databases, all with their own
        <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards"
          ><s>Kanban boards</s></a
        >
        and tickets.
      </article-text>
      <article-image>
        <img
          src="../../img/notion-databases/notion-databases.jpg"
          style="grid-column: span 12"
          alt="Representation of three Kanban boards: Social Media, Sales Campaigns
          and Tasks"
        />
        <text-caption role="none">

          and Tasks
        </text-caption>
      </article-image>
      <article-text>
        Because these boards were all created at different times, by various
        people, they didn’t looked the same. In a way, these boards evolved with
        us, and you could tell that by the way that each one was constructed.
        This meant, for example, that there were several properties with
        equivalent meaning that had different name structures, and when you’re
        scaling, that’s a truly bad idea.

      <article-text>
        Another issue was the existence of duplicate tickets. A Sale Campaign
        action will very probably also be a Social Media action, and if it meant
        preparing some assets for printing, it would also be a Tasks action.
        Only on very rare occasions we had tickets spanning the three databases,
        but it was very common to have duplicates between Sales and Socials, as
        they are practically the same.<br />
        Duplicates also meant that there was two (and sometimes three)
        communication routes. A ticket could have the status “waiting for
        approval” while the other equivalent ticket would have “approved, post
        within three days”.<br />
        <br />
        This happens because the databases were not synced. But they could be.

        />
      </article-image>
      <article-text>
        An option to solve this could be merging databases, it’s something that
        Notion allows users to do, but given that we have mismatching
        properties, the amount of work that it would require made me decide
        against it. For reference, doing this would mean: open ticket, check all
        data, get every property right, delete obsolete properties, repeat. And
        it wouldn’t even tackle the duplicates issue, as it would import all the
        tickets to the same database, and the user would need to add “choose
        which duplicate ticket to delete” to the already exhausting list of
        tasks.<br />
        <br />
        Taking this into consideration, I decided to go the manual way. Create a
        new database and one by one import all the tickets, sounds slow right?
        Keep reading and you’ll find out why it worked better than the
        alternative.<br />
        <br />
        First, we have to decide what properties will be needed. This is not
        only an exercise of future-proofing your system, but also a work of
        nomenclature and classes (not those classes, Karl).<br />
        <br />
        For this, new properties might be created and older ones might be
        deleted, the important is to keep the logic simple, open, preferably on
        a reading order, and avoid too specific properties (a Local property is
        probably unnecessary for a Communications’ team, but the Media Channels
        is very important!).<br />
        <br />
        So, for properties, here’s what I decided:<br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <b>Captain</b>
          (Property Type: Person)<br />
          The main face of the ticket, usually the person to contact in case of
          any doubts;
        </ul>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <b>People</b>
          (Multi-select)<br />
          As more than one person can be simultaneously working on the same
          task, here is where you tag everyone;
        </ul>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <b>Date</b>
          (Date)<br />
          The relevant date of each topic;
        </ul>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <b>Media Channel</b>
          (Multi-select)<br />
          Where will it be published;
        </ul>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <b>Tags</b>
          (Multi-select)<br />
          To make search for archived tickets easier;
        </ul>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <b>Databases</b>
          (Multi-select)<br />
          The database to which the ticket should be attached to;
        </ul>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <b>Status</b>
          (Selection)<br />
          The current status of the ticket topic;
        </ul>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <b>Priority</b>
          (Selection)<br />
          The level of importance of each task;
        </ul>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <b>Comments</b>
          (Text)<br />
          Extra bits of information;
        </ul>
      </article-text>

        Second, we just need to create different table views that filter the
        Database property input. This will allow you to create the perception of
        different databases, as you’ll only see specific tickets in each
        view.<br />
        <br />
        Using Notion’s Filter option, after creating a new table view, we apply
        the filter “Database contains” followed by the view’s target. So,
        following my team’s example, after all filters get applied we should
        have a table with at least three different views (Social Media, Tasks
        and Sales Campaigns), and each view will only show you tickets that have
        those databases applied.<br />
        <br />
        If you make the Database property a Multi-select type, you should also
        be able to see tickets that are shared between databases, and that’s
        where the magic is!<br />
        <br />
        We now have Synced Pseudo-Databases. Remember, all of this is just one
        database, but because we’re filtering out based on the ticket’s
        properties, it gives the impression and functionality of several
        databases.

      <article-text
        >After some orientation and restructuring of processes, this proved to
        be a great way of organizing tickets across several boards. As I see it,
        the pros of synchronous databases highly outpace the cons of time
        invested on rebuilding the system.<br />
        <br />
        By syncing the information, we allow communication to flow undoubtedly
        between teammates, without the need for extra messages, reducing the
        time needed to pick up tasks. It also simplifies the life of the team’s
        coordinator, as there are no more duplicates and changes applied to a
        ticket will be reachable independently of the pseudo-database that
        you’re at.<br />
        <br />
        <callout>
          <b>Important!</b><br />
          For this system to work, it’s necessary to implement a disciplined
          ticket creation. Not filling the Database Property will result on not
          seeing the ticket on your pseudo-databases.
