      <article-text>
        Few things have been as polarizing to the creative community as the
        introduction of Generative Artificial Intelligence, but why? And is
        there something that we can do about it?<br />
        <br />
        <i
          >August 1, 2024, update:<br />
          While writing this article, a new EU Policy came out, the
          <a
            href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai"
            ><s>AI Act</s></a
          >. This policy consists on a framework of laws and prohibitions
          regarding the implementation of unethical or unsafe AI application
          inside the EU territory. Some of these new laws solve a few issues
          that I’ll talk later on this article, but I decided to leave said
          issues unaltered anyways, adding a [*] so that you can identify
          them.<br />
          <br />
          In this opinion article, I’ll be exploring the Generative facet of AI,
          so you will be reading Generative Artificial Intelligence, Generative
          AI and GenAI interchangeably.<br />
          <br />
          This is the right place to leave a disclaimer that I’m not an AI
          expert, and that what you’re about to read is an opinion and not a
          scientific study on the matter.<br />
          It is also pertinent to point out that, even though I used to use
          Adobe’s GenAI tools with moderation and I’ve had my share part of AI
          experiments, I am not in favor of it’s unrestrained growth, and I
          consider that limitations should be artificially imposed, such as the
          right to consent and a [*]stronger enforcement on content manipulation
          that aims to create disorder and fear.</i
