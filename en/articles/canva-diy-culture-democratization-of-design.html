        While writing this article, Affinity, a creative software developed by Serif Europe, and <a href="https://www.creativebrandsmag.com/canva-acquires-affinity-cementing-its-position-as-a-design-powerhouse/"><s>in 2024 acquired by Canva</s></a>, had a new release where it was made totally free (except for the AI features). This was great timing, taking into consideration that I was ranting exactly about that.
      </i><br>
      <i>
        I’ll use the name Canva loosely here. At this point, I think it makes sense to recognize that Canva had such an impact on the industry, that it’s okay to use it to describe the type of software, not the tool itself. <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/773987/adobe-launches-creative-cloud-express-to-compete-with-canva/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"><s>Did you know that tools like Adobe Express are a direct response to Canva’s success?</s></a>
      </i><br>
      Many artists have heard the nightmare-inducing comment: <italic>“I could do that too”</italic>. Poor Pollock still suffers from it to this day. Eventually, Designers would too agonize from this stigma. <italic>“That’s just a button!”</italic> or <italic>“My kid could do that!”</italic> are two sentences a Designer will inevitably hear time and time again in its career.<br>
      <br>
      Now, ask any designer what Canva is, and I guarantee you that there’s no designer alive that doesn’t recognize this name. The answer is either <italic>“Canva is the most oblivious, unnecessary, unprofessional, career-destroyer, uncreative piece of software that exists”</italic> or <italic>“yeah, I know it, it works”</italic>.<br>
      <br>
      To me, Canva is a beautiful tool of power for the people (which is different from power-tool, we’ll get into <b>that</b> later).<br>
      <br>
      Canva, and all similar alternatives, brought to the surface—to the common person—the power to make things. This power came with a tone of Do-It-Yourself-ism in it.<br>
      <br>
      I’m kind of a designer myself. Between paying for all the software, going through design school, and insisting on calling it a <italic>typeface</italic> and not a <italic>font</italic>, I do understand where my colleagues’ frustration comes from every time they hear <italic>“My nephew did it on Canva, can you change the colours?”</italic>—we spend years learning something to then become the <italic>expensive last choice</italic>. <br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, I will tell you why I think that Canva can be a great opportunity for the designer’s world.<br>

      <h3>A free entry</h3><br>
      Years ago, when I first started playing around with computers, I had no idea what design was, but I knew where to find—on that old, beige, CRT monitor—the icon that would transport me to the incredible world of <b>MS Paint!</b><br>
      <br>
      Oh, how beautiful it was!<br>
      I could draw shapes and then paint them!<br>
      I could write words, and then paint them!<br>
      I could zoom all in, play with individual pixels, making super intricate knots… And then paint them!<br>
      <br>
      And it was all FREE. Sure, my dad “paid” for the Windows licence, but MS Paint definitely did not have a subscription-based paywall to use.<br>
      <br>
      Years later I would venture myself through other software galaxies, I tried paint.NET, Krita, GIMP and even a weird online photoshop clone that allowed to have a remote friend painting with you in real time. Now that is a real collaborative feature. Take notes, Adobe!<br>
      <br>
      All of this to say, if not for MS Paint (my free ticket), I wouldn’t even know that I had an interest in something I would later call *Design*. Thus, what’s the logic behind the hate towards a free tool that allows new people to enter such a world? Why would we be proudly gatekeeping something that could’ve got us in this world?<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Yes, people know, even <italic>Canva</italic> knows</h3><br>
      <italic>“Canva is not comparable to professional tools like InDesign!”</italic>—Yes, dear proud professional, they know that, and they’re not trying to be it. Canva knows what it is, and what type of project generally gets created in it. You’re not supposed to edit a 300-page book on a canva-esque software. You’re not supposed to edit your brother’s wedding photos in it. And you definitely shouldn’t be designing an e-commerce B2B multinational adaptive solution in it. Canva has its target, you’re just probably not it.<br>
      <br>
      These tools are very powerful, but they don’t replace traditional software, nor is their goal to do so. And here’s the thing: if it ever does replace it, why not just use it instead of whining about it? What’s so bad about being seen using a tool that the mere mortal un-designers also use? We can all use a needle and thread, but that doesn’t mean that tailors are useless! I could bet that you’ve come across design made on this type of software without even noticing it—great designers make great work, no matter the tool!<br>
      <br>
      <callout>
        Furthermore, it is a tool. Bend it to fit your needs and you’ll be amazed at what you can get out of it! While not directly about Canva, you can find some inspiration on my previous article, <a href="https://davidherdeiro.com/en/articles/software-bending.html"><s>Software Bending</s></a>.

      <h3>Do it. Yourself</h3><br>
      I am not a developer, yet that didn’t stop me from building my own website. After working with tens of developers in the past, no one batted an eye for trying to learn how to do it alone (even if my tools looked rudimental to them). Besides, these pages are 90% pure HTML and CSS, and 10% hot glue in a shoebox. Think of it like this: if you were a woodworker, would you be mad at someone learning how to make a chair at home?<br>
      <br>
      Having the will to learn how to use these kinds of software, for the mere purpose of designing a birthday card for your nephew, should not be seen as a bad thing! People are designing all by themselves, and that’s the important thing to keep in mind. They’re using free tools that are working not only as a learning path, but as an enabler. <b>Designing on canva-esque software should not be looked frowned upon, but the opposite: it should be celebrated, for it can be the start to a great career!</b><br>
      <br>
      <h3>It’s okay to be afraid</h3><br>
      I get it. If, out of the blue, everyone thinks they are designers, then what will happen to us-already-designers? It’s an understandable feeling. Suddenly, it feels like people will stop relying on you because they can make design-y stuff all by themselves.<br>
      <br>
      But here’s the thing: There’s only so much that people without design experience and literacy can do before they need an expert. They can use WordPress templates to create a website, or design social media posts on Canva. They might even try to use MS PowerPoint to design a logotype. Eventually, it will become obvious that real knowledge is still the way to go. So, fellow designers, we’re safe—after all, it’s not other people that we should be mad at, if you know what <italic>AI mean</italic>.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>It’s better when everyone gets it</h3><br>
      If everybody has the power to patch their pants, or buy wood to make furniture, then what’s the issue with allowing people to design on their own? If they want professionally sewed jackets, they’ll call a tailor, and if they want a sturdy table, they’ll go to a carpenter. So, if they want a professional design, they will still email you. It’s your job to do your best, with or without free tools.<br>
