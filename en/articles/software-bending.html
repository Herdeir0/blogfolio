      <i>
        Desenrascanço: (de.sen.ras.can.ço) [Portuguese] [informal] The capacity to solve problems or difficulties quickly, without proper tools. A term that very well defines the personality of this writer.<br>
        <br>
        Synonyms: [formal] Improvisation; [slang] Desemerdar;

      <br>
      Software bending, a term that I appropriated from the animated series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299"><s>“Avatar: The Last Airbender”</s></a>, is the capacity, or superpower if you will, of picking up software and <italic>bend</italic> its features to your needs, therefore using it for purposes other than their intended purposes.<br>
      <br>
      Let's take a look at <a href="https://www.figma.com"><s>Figma</s></a>, for example, a great UI prototyping tool. You have probably already seen people use it as a digital media creation tool, like social media posts. Did you know that you can install editorial plugins? You’d be effectively making it a more than capable editorial tool for small projects!

        While you’re at it, why not use it as a storyboard tool with animatic capabilities? Each Figma frame is a key frame and you still have the benefit of being able to animate it. Are you looking for a motion designer freelancer? Use Figma and in a few minutes you have both a storyboard and an animatic.

      Another, and maybe a bit more obvious, example, are video editing tools. Imagine you have a JPEG image that you really, really, need to edit, but all you have available is a video tool like <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/"><s>DaVinci Resolve</s></a>. Worry not, for you already have all you need!<br>
      <br>
      <callout>See it like this: a lot of what you'd do on Photoshop or Lightroom can be done on any prosumer grade video editing software.</callout>
      <br>
      Open DaVinci Resolve or <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html"><s>Adobe Premiere</s></a> and import your JPEG. You can correct and grade colors, apply filters and masks, adjust contrast and saturation, and in the end, simply export your viewport frame. Some video editing tools can even export it as a TIFF!

      Vector is a bit more complicated to do outside a specialized based tool, but don't let that stop you! Let's say that you have a vector graphic of a blue icon, and you desperately need to change its color to red. Not a problem! Here’s how you can do it on the browser:<br>
      <ul>Open the file on any browser;</ul>
      <ul>Right-click on the icon and select Inspect (or press F12, for my dear power users);</ul>
      <ul>Look for the SVG tags and inside it, find the value <italic>fill=“…”</italic>, mostly certain it will have a hexadecimal value in it, but you can change it to any color mode you like, like RGBA or HSL;</ul>
      <ul>Change it to your liking;</ul>
      <ul>Right-click on the image again, and select <italic>Save As</italic>.</ul>
      <br>
      Since this is an SVG image, it will allow you to save it in the same format with your chosen color! Take into consideration that this only works with vectorial graphics, not bitmap images (where you can only apply filters, not changing the graphic code).<br>
      <br>
      Now, if you really want to go full maniac on it, there’s nothing stopping you from editing the SVG paths through the browser, but admittedly, at that point, it would be quicker to download InkScape or use Figma online…

      These are all simple examples of a good design-focused <italic>desenrascanço</italic>, and several of them already came in handy for me at some point in my career. Nevertheless, such actions should be properly considered before engaging in them. If you want to add a shape to a SVG, you’ll probably save time if you google “free svg editor online”. If you have to create a 100-page printed document, perhaps Figma will give you a bigger headache than simply looking for a specific alternative. At the end of the day, all that matters is that you have achieved the desired goal without compromising on shameful errors!<br>
      <br>
      The <italic>desenrascanço</italic> is, above everything, a creative tool, and much like any other software, there’s a time and place for it. Remember that it is not about using it the most, but rather using it the best!<br>
