      Community events should be exactly that: for the community.<br>
      <br>

      They should aim to bring value to the community, give the community a voice, and be designed with the community in
      mind.<br>
      <br>

      The value of such events comes not only from the talks and presentations but also from the interactions that
      happen outside them. Replacing a Q&A session or networking opportunity with one or two extra presentations might
      make the schedule look fuller, but it doesn’t necessarily add value to the event.<br>
      <br>

      From my experience organizing events in the past, I’ve realized that the talks and workshops provide
      only half the value participants take away. The other half comes from interactions—whether with speakers or other
      community members. It’s during these Q&A sessions and networking moments that participants can ask more specific
      questions, find a group of people who share similar interests, or perhaps even discover a company looking for
      someone with their skill set.<br>
      <br>

      An event claiming to be “for the community” cannot have the majority of its speakers or hosts come from outside
      that community. That approach fails to give the local community a voice. Events should focus on the local
      community—regional first, then national. This doesn’t mean excluding outside perspectives; diversity is important.
      For example, bringing a talk about Madrid to Barcelona, or having a marketing speaker at a design event,
      can add richness. However, balance is key. If an event in Paris includes two speakers from Lyon, it should,
      whenever possible, also feature at least two speakers from Paris.<br>
      <br>

      Lastly, events should be designed with the community in mind.<br>
      <br>

      Not all events can be free, of course, but they must be proportionate to the financial capacity of the
      community.<br>
      <br>

      If an event is held in an area with a significant number of students interested in the topic, the pricing should
      reflect the financial realities of students and recent graduates, making it feasible for these groups to attend.
      There are ways to lower event costs—through support from local municipalities or partnerships with local
      businesses, for example. Additionally, events should be scheduled outside of working or school hours, ensuring
      greater accessibility. The complexity of the content should also vary; a community event isn’t just for experts.
      For example, the design community in the Algarve includes students, juniors, seniors, and educators, so a
      community-focused event should cater to all levels of experience.<br>
      <br>

      The best resource for creating community events is the people who are part of that community.<br>
